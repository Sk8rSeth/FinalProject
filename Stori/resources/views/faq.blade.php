<div class="label_long">How Do I End A Story?</div>
<p>All you have to do is add this to a comment <span>== End ==</span>all by itself, and if it becomes the highest voted, it will automatically end the story, and add it to the Archives.</p>
<div class="label_long">What The Hell's a 'Commit'?</div>
<p>A commit is when a comment gets COMMITED to the story, so the '# of commits' section [for example] says how many comments have been added to the story</p>
